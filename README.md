## üóíÔ∏è Note
>These libraries have only been tested on a factory TI-Nspire CX II CAS with the latest firmware.<br>
All other firmware and hardware has not been proven to work, but most likely will.
## üêç Python Libraries
### CustomMath
An extended math library designed to replace certain functions and data structures from `numpy` and other commonly used math libraries.<br>
**Current Submodules**
- Matrix - Barebones matrix math implementation
### threedee
A collection of tools used for 3D rendering and calculations.<br>
**Current Submodules**
- Camera - Camera class used in `threedee.Point3D` for projection
- Point3D - A class for creating, representing, and manipulating 3D points
## TI-Basic Programs
No TI-Basic programs are currently being developed for TinSpire, but keep an eye out!

Once you've found a software that works, download the latest release of `PyLib.zip`.<br>
Once downloaded, extract the `PyLib` directory and copy it to the root of your calculator, merging it with the existing `PyLib` directory.<br>

2) To install each module, navigate to each new document in the `PyLib` directory and:
    1) Navigate to the python file with the same name as the module.<br> (For example, to install the `CustomMath` module, navigate to `CustomMath.py`)
